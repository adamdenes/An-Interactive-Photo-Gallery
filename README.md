# An-Interactive-Photo-Gallery

In this project, I have created an interactive photo gallery using **JavaScript** and **CSS Grid** Layout.

Users are able to filter the gallery using the search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input.

When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. This was achieved via [baguetteBox.js](https://www.google.com) plugin.
